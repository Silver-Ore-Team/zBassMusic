# zBassMusic

zBassMusic is a modern music system for Gothic games based on ZenGin.
It replaces the original DirectMusic system with a
custom engine built on top of [BASS Audio Library](https://www.un4seen.com/) to provide easier workflow for composers
and additional functions for the
perfect soundtrack design. The most important features include:

Features:

* Direct playback of common audio formats (WAV, OGG, MP3) instead of DirectMusic proprietary formats
* Out-of-the-box support for existing music theme definitions (just change the audio file)
* Alternative scheduling & transition systems to support smooth cross-fades between themes
* Loading of music files from VDF volumes (DirectMusic required physical files)
* Scriptable interface for controlling the system from Deadalus scripts
* Backward compatibility with original .sgt music (it's redirected to the DirectMusic system)

## Getting Started

Download `zBassMusic.vdf` and place it inside `<GOTHIC_ROOT>/Data` with Union installed to automatically load the system
at the start of the game. With default settings you can use modern audio formats directly in `MusicInst.d` like:

```cpp
instance SYS_MENU(C_MUSICTHEME_DEF)
{
	// 1. WAV file will load and play instead of .sgt
	file = "modern_audio_file.wav";      // old: file = "gamestart.sgt";
	
	// 2. You can use `transtype` to enable simple fade-in-fade-out transitions
	//      TRANSITION_TYPE_INTRO        - fade-in on start
	//      TRANSITION_TYPE_END          - fade-out on end
	//      TRANSITION_TYPE_ENDANDINTRO  - fade-in on start AND fade-out on end
	transtype = TRANSITION_TYPE_ENDANDINTRO;
	transsubtype = TRANSITION_SUB_TYPE_BEAT;
	
	// 3. Bass can emulate DX8 Reverb effect but in a limited range 
	reverbmix = -12;    // reverbmix in [-96, 0]        (dB)
	reverbtime = 3000;  // reverbtime in [0.001, 3000]  (milliseconds0)
	// If your instance exceeds these limits, the effect will not apply!
};
```
