# Themes

Music Theme is a single song in the soundtrack that needs to be defined in the music scripts for zBassMusic to know about.
Each theme has an audio file that needs to be placed inside `_work/Data/Music/` directory (physical or virtual).

You can define a theme using either:

* [C_MUSICTHEME](cmusictheme.md) - original class from Gothic, limited to basic settings
* [zBassMusic Theme](basstheme.md) - new class for defining advanced settings in zBassMusic
